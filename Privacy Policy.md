# Privacy Policy
Thank you for reading this Privacy Policy. As the bot owner, my top priority is the safety and privacy of all users. Please read below to learn how your information is handled.

### 1. Collected Data  
The Gholdengo Bot collects data such as Server ID, User ID, Channel ID, and Discord Username. The Gholdengo Bot is also able to read any message content following certain command triggers. This applies to the g!sendgif, g!math, and ;w triggers, in addition to their slash command counterparts (/sendgif, /math, /wiki)

### 2. Why do we need to collect this info?  
We collect Server/User/Channel ID and Usernames for command verification purposes only; User IDs and Usernames are used to verify if error suppression needs to be turned off (error suppression is turned on for regular users since these errors are annoying) and if the user is blacklisted from the used command or the entire bot. Server ID and Channel ID are used to verify if the user is trying to use a command that is still being tested and needs to be used in a designated testing server, as well as to check if the server is blacklisted from the used command or the entire bot. Command usage and messages following command triggers are NOT CURRENTLY LOGGED, but may be set up in the future for moderation purposes. Bot Designer for Discord (BDFD) locks in-app logs behind a premium feature, so the future setup of logs would be in a private discord channel that only the bot owner/dev team can see. No additional data other than the ones mentioned previously will be included in the future logs setup.

### 3. How do we protect our users' data?  
As mentioned in the previous answer, logs are locked behind BDFD Premium and is not currently set up to a bot owner channel redirect. As such, the bot owner is unable to view logs containing Server ID, User ID, Channel ID, and Discord Username. When the redirect logs are set up in the future, it will be to a private discord channel that only the bot/owner/dev team can see for quality assurance and bug fixes. This channel will not be made public.

### 4. How can you get your data wiped/become anonymous?  
Unfortunately, data wipes and anonymous settings cannot be done, as it would involve manually putting Server/User IDs into the code, which is counterintiuitive and would also allow users/servers to circumvent a blacklist. However, when channel redirect logs are set up in the future, I will add commands and user/server variables that make it so Server IDs, User IDs, Channel IDs, and Discord Usernames display as anonymous in the private logs channel.
